# Rami Ezzeddine

Business Informatics student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) with a strong focus on blockchain technology, tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), and data-driven software systems. I combine technical implementation with economic reasoning, legal-regulatory awareness, and enterprise IT experience to design systems that are both innovative and practically deployable.

## About Me

- B.Sc. Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik), Technical University of Munich  
- SAP HCM Consultant with experience in enterprise HR systems  
- Head of Legal & Finance at the TUM Blockchain Club  
- Several years of experience in finance, accounting, and corporate structuring  
- Background in market research, data analysis, and software engineering  
- Experience in academic research as well as startup and applied project environments  

My interests lie at the intersection of **enterprise software, decentralized technologies, and regulatory frameworks**. I am particularly interested in how modern blockchain-based systems can integrate with established enterprise environments and existing legal and financial infrastructures.

## Areas of Interest

- Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technology  
- Tokenization of Real-World Assets (real estate, vehicles, securities)
- Enterprise systems and process digitization (SAP HCM)  
- Smart contracts and on-chain settlement mechanisms  
- DeFi, market design, and financial infrastructure  
- Data engineering, analytics, and ETL pipelines  
- Legal and regulatory frameworks (MiCAR, eWpG, corporate and non-profit structures)

## Technical Skills

**Programming & Data**  
- Java (backend development, data scraping, ETL pipelines)  
- Python (data processing, analytics, tooling)  
- SQL (relational databases, data modeling)  
- Solidity (Ethereum smart contracts)  
- R (data analysis, tidyverse, academic work)

**Enterprise & Blockchain Systems**  
- SAP HCM (advice consulting, process analysis, system configuration)  
- Ethereum and EVM-based systems  
- Hedera Token Service (HTS)  
- Smart contract design, deployment, and testing  
- Token models (fungible tokens, NFTs, hybrid structures)

**Tools & Infrastructure**  
- Git & GitHub (version control, collaboration)  
- Maven, Remix, Hardhat  
- Supabase and SQL-based backends  
- Data collection, transformation, and storage workflows  

**Finance, Law & Research**  
- Financial modeling and bookkeeping  
- Corporate structuring (UG, GmbH, non-profits)  
- Compliance-oriented system design  
- Academic writing and research (seminar papers, LNCS format)

## Projects

This profile contains a mix of:
- Blockchain and smart-contract prototypes  
- Tokenization and settlement architecture experiments  
- Data scraping and market analytics tools  
- SAP- and enterprise-related technical projects  
- Academic and research-oriented software projects  

Most repositories are prototype-based or research-driven, with a focus on exploring architectural and regulatory trade-offs.

## Current Focus

- Explicit token settlement beyond message-based approaches  
- Tokenization architectures using NFTs with linked financial instruments  
- Blockchain choreography and process-aware smart contracts  
- Bridging enterprise systems and Web3 infrastructure in a compliant way
